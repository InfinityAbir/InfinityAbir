# Hi, I'm Abir Hasan 👋

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=InfinityAbir&label=Profile%20Views&color=0e75b6&style=flat)

I build clean, secure web applications focused on performance, structure, and real-world usability.

Currently working deeply with **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **EF Core**, **SQL Server**, and **Azure deployment**.  
Previously built production-style projects using **Python (Django)**, **PHP**, and modern web stacks.

I care about writing maintainable code, designing proper database schemas, and shipping complete systems — not just demos.

---

## 🔧 What I Build

- ASP.NET Core MVC apps with role-based authentication
- EF Core + SQL Server (migrations, seeding, reporting, pagination)
- REST APIs with Swagger documentation
- Structured CRUD systems with validation & clean UI
- Azure deployments and environment configuration
- Feature development and bug fixing in existing .NET projects
