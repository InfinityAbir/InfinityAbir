# Hi, I'm **Abir Hasan** 👋

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=InfinityAbir&label=Profile%20Views&color=0e75b6&style=flat)

I build clean, secure web apps. These days I’m focused on **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **EF Core**, and **SQL Server**, with Azure deployment. Previously I’ve shipped projects in **Python/Django**, **PHP**, and classic web stacks. Always learning, always shipping.

---

## 🔧 What I Do

- **ASP.NET Core MVC apps** with role-based auth, CRUD, validation, and neat UI
- **EF Core + SQL Server**: migrations, seeding, pagination, filtering, reporting
- **APIs** with Swagger docs and Postman collections
- **Deployments** to Azure App Service (and CI/CD when needed)
- **Fixes & feature work** on existing .NET projects
